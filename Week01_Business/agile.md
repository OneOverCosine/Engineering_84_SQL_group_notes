## The Agile Manifesto

### And the 4 Values of Agile

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing is and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

**Individuals and Interactions** over *Processes and Tools*

**Working Software** over *Comprehensive Documentation*

**Customer Collaboration** over *Contract Negotiation*

**Responding to Change** over *Following a Plan*

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
