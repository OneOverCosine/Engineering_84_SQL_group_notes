### Developers Main Goal(s)

Creating new features and fixing bugs in the shortest time possible. They need to stay ahead of the competition to keep their customers happy.

### Operations Main Goal(s)

Maintaining a high server uptime and stable builds of the product. They want to keep their customers happy.

### Problems

- Working in silos, Development and Operations teams don't communicate effectively; Development wants to quickly role out new features while Operations want to maintain a stable product.
- Development and production environments are often different. Code that works for the developers can end up with bugs when moved into production.
- It can take anywhere from weeks to months for the Operations team to review the work the developers have done, slowing things down for them.

### **What is DevOps?**

DevOps integrates development and operations teams to improve collaboration and productivity. It does this by automating infrastructure and workflows, and by continuosly measuring application performance.

### **What are the benefits of DevOps?**

- The focus on automation means that less time is spent doing repetitive tasks
- Development and production environments are the same, meaning that errors relating to environment no longer happen
- Software is written in small chunks. This allows for more frequent tests and code reviews so any problems are caught quickly and accurately
